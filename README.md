Project name: Electra
Live link: https://electra-5fb97.web.app
Github server: https://github.com/Athiqur01/Electra-server
Github Client: https://github.com/Athiqur01/Electra
To locally run a project named the steps are:
1. Clone the Project from GitHub
1.	Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
2.	Clone the Repository: Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Athiqur01/Electra
3.	Navigate into the Project Directory:
cd electra
2. Install Project Dependencies
1.	Ensure Node.js and npm are Installed:
o	You need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
o	You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running:
node -v
npm -v
o	If not installed, download and install from Node.js official website.
2.	Install Dependencies:
o	Run the following command in the project directory to install all the necessary dependencies:
npm install
3. Run the Project Locally
1.	Start the Development Server:
o	After the dependencies are installed, start the React development server by running:
npm start
o	This will compile the project and start a development server. By default, it should be available at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
4. Set Up Firebase (If Needed)
Since the project is hosted on Firebase, there may be Firebase-specific configurations in the project, such as Firebase Authentication, Firestore, or Hosting.
1.	Check for Firebase Configuration:
o	Look for a firebaseConfig object in your project, typically in a file like src/firebase.js or src/config.js.
o	If you need to connect to your own Firebase project, replace the existing Firebase config with your own.
2.	Install Firebase Tools (Optional):
o	If you need to deploy or manage Firebase directly from the command line, you can install Firebase CLI:
npm install -g firebase-tools
o	Log in to Firebase:
bash
Copy code
firebase login
5. Deployment to Firebase (Optional)
If you need to deploy the project to Firebase Hosting, follow these steps:
1.	Initialize Firebase:
o	Run the following command and follow the prompts to set up Firebase Hosting:
firebase init
2.	Build the Project:
o	Create a production build of the React project:
npm run build
3.	Deploy to Firebase:
o	Deploy the build to Firebase Hosting:
bash
firebase deploy
6. Test and Develop Locally
•	Hot Reloading: As you develop, the development server supports hot reloading, so changes you make in the code will automatically reflect in the browser.
•	Testing: If the project includes tests, you can run them using:
npm test
